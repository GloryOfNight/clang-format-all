# Introduction
100% overkill and 20% cooler way to reformat your entire code base resulting in 313% overall stupidness of this project.
This project is a result of me getting annoyed by scripts that was too long to reformat directory.

Code written in C++17 Standard.
Thanks to `<execution>`, i can execute clang-format in parallel policy that results in actual good perfomance of that application. 

There are no special dependencies, project can be build and run on: Windows and Unix.
