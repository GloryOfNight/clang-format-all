# Introduction
This project is a result of me getting annoyed by scripts that were taking too long to reformat directory of somewhat big project.
Consider using it when you have > 200 code files. It improves speed of reformating all files in specified directory compared to shell script alternatives.

Code written in C++17 Standard.
Thanks to `<execution>`, I execute clang-format in parallel policy that results in actual good perfomance of that application. 

There are no special dependencies, project can be easily compiled for Windows and Unix systems. 

Demo of me formatting Unreal Engine 4.26.2 `Engine/Source` folder and also providing args to ignore folders `Editor Developers . . .`

# Prerequisites
Please make sure you have installed [clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) and set LLVM environment variable.

You can also provide command line argument for clang-format executable manually. Please see options section below.

# Download
Pre-build download avaible thru [releases](https://github.com/GloryOfNight/clang-format-all/releases) page.

# Options
- `--verbose` enable a little bit more detail logging
- `-S` optional, specify source directory to reformat, if not prodived program will use current working directory as source
- `-E` optional, specify clang-format executable path, if not provided program will try to find it for LLVM path env variable
- `-I` optional, ignore folders or files in releative paths to `-S`
- `-C` optional, specify additional command-line arguments for clang-format command, for example --dry-run --Werror

example command (git bash, windows):

`./clang-format-all.exe -S C:/4.26.2-release/Engine/Source -E Tools/clang-format.exe -I Editor Developer ThirdParty -C "--dry-run --Werror" --verbose`
