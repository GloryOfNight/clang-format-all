# Introduction
This tool will help you reformat C++ project directory (or any directory containing Cxx files) using clang-format in fast multithreaded manor.
Typical scripts are not very effective at reformating huge amouts of files at one go. This tool solves the issue by using newests features of C++17 standard.

There are no special dependencies, project can be easily compiled for Windows and Unix systems. 

# Download
Pre-build download avaible thru [releases](https://github.com/GloryOfNight/clang-format-all/releases) page.

# Build
On Linux: `sh ./scripts/build_unix.sh` NOTE: you might need to install libtbb for successfull build!

On Windows (git bash): `./scripts/build_win.bat`

# Options
- `-S` optional, specify source directory to reformat, if not prodived program will use current working directory as source
- `-I` optional, ignore folders or files in releative paths to `-S`
- `-E` optional, specify clang-format executable path, if not provided program will try to find it from [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) path env variable
- `-C` optional, specify additional command-line arguments for clang-format command, for example --dry-run --Werror --style firefox
- `--verbose` enable more logging (could slow down the perfomance!)
- `--no-logs` disable console output (could slighly improve the perfomance)

example command (git bash, windows):

`./clang-format-all.exe -S C:/4.26.2-release/Engine/Source -E Tools/clang-format.exe -I Editor Developer ThirdParty -C "--dry-run --Werror" --verbose`
